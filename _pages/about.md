I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **University of Florence** in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, working with [Carlotta Giannelli](https://people.dimai.unifi.it/giannelli/) on Geometric Deep Learning for surface approximation and parametrization.

I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the **University of Rome “Tor Vergata”**, supported by the [GRAPES](http://grapes-network.eu/) network, a Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN, under the supervision of [Carla Manni](http://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~manni/home_ing.html) and [Hendrik Speleers](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~speleers/). My thesis, titled "Non-Uniform Degree and Tchebycheffian Spline Technologies for Adaptive Isogeometric Analysis," explored innovative spline technologies for adaptive computational methods.

Previously, I completed my MSc in Computational Engineering at **Ruhr University Bochum**, where I gained expertise in Finite Element Methods and later specialized in Isogeometric Analysis.
